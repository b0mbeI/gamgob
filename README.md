## Introduction

> Lightweight web enumeration CLI tool written in Python

GAMGOB is a command-line web enumeration tool designed for low-impact HTTP content discovery.
It performs directory and endpoint enumeration using a wordlist and reports HTTP response
status codes along with response size and request duration.

This tool was created as a learning exercise and does not perform authentication attacks,
password brute forcing, or vulnerability exploitation.  
_Use this tool only on systems you own or have explicit authorization to test._

> All examples use **example.com**, which is reserved for documentation and testing purposes.
